# Getting started

Designing and building digital services for the Co‑op
We are aiming to create familiarity across Co‑op services. Familiarity makes things quicker and easier for our users — it helps them understand our services and trust us.

Our design system is made up of principles, guidelines and tools that help us design and build user-centered Co‑op services.
